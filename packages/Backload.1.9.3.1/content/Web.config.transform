      *** IMPORTANT NOTE: 
      Since version 1.9.2 the section name has changed from name="fileUpload" to name="backload" (see below). 
      The root element must also be changed in your config file from <fileUpload> to <backload>
      The ConfigurationSection class has changed to <section type="Backload.Configuration.BackloadSection ..." />
      
	  You can make the config settings in the web.config. Alternatively you can use a seperate config file
      as shown below in most examples. Just copy this section declaration with the appropriate configSource 
      attribute into your Web.config file.
      For more on config options and settings refer to the wiki on GitHub (https://github.com/blackcity/Backload) 
      or use the Web.Backload.Default.config file as a starting point.
